  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it'sthe first one I build myself!
  </p>

  <p>
    The site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see my journey is going!
